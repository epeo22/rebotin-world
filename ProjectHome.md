Rebotin's world was created at Universidad Privada Boliviana (http://www.upb.edu) as a simple programming language to teach school students basic algorithmic skills. It is based on a language called Rebotinol, which is very simple to understand, yet powerful enough to provide some interesting programming challenges. With Rebotin, the focus is shifted from learning the language constructs to learning the algorithms.
